<h5>Swing frame application for printing cards</h5><br>
<h6>Instructions:</h6><br>
1. Download Application_Data.rar to get the necessary jar files and other folders(images, sample excel sheet etc.).<br>
2. The code can be found in Application_Data: src-->JavaDB_001-->Secondbox.java or the application code (.java) file on git. <br>
3. To get an executable file, use an external application, or a Java IDE(in which case you will get an .jar file).<br>
4. If none of the above works, feel free to contact me.
